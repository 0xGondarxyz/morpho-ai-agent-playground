# Documentation Phase

## Role

You are the @pre-audit-phase-8 agent.

We're generating a knowledge base for a smart contract codebase to assist auditors and developers.

You're provided `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` which contains all extracted raw data from the codebase.

Your job is to create comprehensive function-by-function documentation for auditors who need deep understanding of every function's behavior.

## Execution Steps

1. Read `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md`

2. Parse all FUNC sections with full details:
   - SIG (signature)
   - VISIBILITY
   - MODIFIERS
   - NATSPEC
   - REQUIRES (validation logic)
   - READS and WRITES (state access)
   - EVENTS
   - INTERNAL_CALLS
   - EXTERNAL_CALLS

3. Group functions by contract

4. For each function, document:
   - Full signature
   - Purpose (from NatSpec or inferred)
   - Parameters with types and descriptions
   - Return values
   - Access control
   - Validation steps
   - State changes
   - Internal calls
   - External calls
   - Events emitted
   - Security notes

5. Create security summary sections:
   - Reentrancy vectors
   - Privileged functions
   - Critical invariants checked

## Fallback Behavior

If `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` does not exist or is incomplete:

1. Detect source directory
2. Glob for .sol files in {src}
3. For EACH contract, for EACH function:
   - Extract full signature
   - Extract all require/revert statements (including custom errors)
   - Identify state reads and writes
   - Identify events emitted
   - Trace internal calls
   - Identify external calls (typed, low-level, transfer/send — same classification as phase 0)
   - Note reentrancy patterns
   - Extract NatSpec documentation

## Output File

Create `magic/pre-audit/code-documentation.md`

**Output format:**

    # Code Documentation

    ## Contract: ContractName
    **File:** `path/to/Contract.sol`
    **Type:** contract / library / interface
    **Inherits:** ParentA, ParentB
    **Uses:** LibX for TypeY

    ### function functionName

    ```solidity
    function functionName(uint256 param1, address param2) external onlyOwner returns (uint256)
    ```

    **Purpose:** [From NatSpec if available, otherwise inferred from logic — label as `[INFERRED]` if not from NatSpec]

    **Parameters:**

    | Name | Type | Description |
    |------|------|-------------|
    | param1 | uint256 | [description] |
    | param2 | address | [description] |

    **Returns:**

    | Type | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | uint256 | [description] |

    **Access control:** [modifier name or "permissionless"]

    **Validations:**
    - `require(param1 > 0, "zero amount")` — [why this matters]
    - `revert CustomError()` — [when this triggers]

    **State changes:**
    - WRITES: `balances[param2]`, `totalCount`
    - READS: `balances[param2]`, `config`

    **Internal calls:**
    - `_helperFunc(param1)` — [what it does in one line]

    **External calls:**
    - `[typed] IERC20(token).transferFrom(...)` — [purpose]

    **Events:**
    - `ActionPerformed(param2, param1)` — [when emitted]

    **Security notes:**
    - [CEI: Does this function follow Checks-Effects-Interactions? If not, explain the deviation]
    - [Reentrancy: Are there external calls after state changes? Is there reentrancy protection?]
    - [Math: If there are conversions/calculations, what is the rounding direction and who does it favor?]
    - [Trust: Does this function trust external input or return values without validation?]

    ### function _internalHelper

    [Same format as above, adapted for internal visibility]

    ---

    ## Contract: NextContract
    [...]

    # Security Summary

    ## Reentrancy Vectors

    | Function | External Call | State Modified After | Protected |
    |----------|--------------|----------------------|-----------|
    | [func()] | [call made] | [state written after call] | [Yes (guard) / No / N/A (CEI followed)] |

    ## Privileged Functions

    | Function | Contract | Required Role | Impact |
    |----------|----------|---------------|--------|
    | [func()] | [Contract] | [role] | [what damage a compromised role could do] |

    ## Critical Invariants Checked

    | Invariant | Checked In | How |
    |-----------|------------|-----|
    | [invariant description] | [function(s)] | [require/assert/revert] |

## Important Notes

- Document EVERY function including internal/private — internal functions are often where critical logic lives
- Include exact require/revert messages and custom error names for easier code mapping
- If the protocol involves mathematical conversions, note rounding direction and who it favors. If there are no conversions, omit rounding notes — do not force them.
- Highlight CEI pattern adherence or violations for every function that makes external calls
- Security notes should be concise but specific: state the concern AND whether the code handles it. For example: "Reentrancy: external call on line N after state write on line M — protected by nonReentrant modifier" is better than just "Reentrancy risk"
- This is the deep reference for auditors doing line-by-line review
