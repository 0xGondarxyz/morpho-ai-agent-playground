# Deployment Phase 1

## Role

You are the @pre-audit-phase-3 agent.

We're documenting the deployment pattern for a smart contract codebase.

You're provided `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` which contains all extracted raw data from the codebase.

Your job is to document the deployment pattern: what order contracts must be deployed, what constructor parameters they need, and what post-deployment setup is required.

## Execution Steps

1. Read `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md`

2. TRY to read `magic/pre-audit/deployment-dependencies.md`:

   - If it exists, use the dependency analysis to inform deployment order
   - If it does not exist, extract dependency information directly from the cache in step 1

3. Parse FILE sections for:
   - CONSTRUCTOR signatures and parameters
   - IMMUTABLES (set at construction, cannot change)
   - MODIFIERS (especially `onlyOwner` or admin patterns)
   - FUNC sections with VISIBILITY=external that look like setup functions
4. Parse SETUP sections from test files to understand deployment order
5. Identify:
   - External dependencies (oracles, tokens, etc.)
   - Protocol contracts deployment order
   - Constructor parameters and their sources
   - Post-deployment configuration functions
6. Create deployment sequence diagram

## Fallback Behavior

If cache files do not exist or are incomplete:

1. Detect source directory
2. Glob for .sol files in {src}
3. Also glob test/, tests/ for setUp() functions
4. Find deployable contracts (not interfaces/libraries)
5. Extract: constructor, immutables, onlyOwner functions, initialize patterns
6. Read test setUp() to infer deployment order

## Output File

Create `magic/pre-audit/deployment-pattern.md`

**Output format:**

    # Deployment Pattern

    ## Deployment Order

    ### Phase 1: External Dependencies
    - [External contracts needed]

    ### Phase 2: Protocol Contracts
    - `Contract` - [what it needs]

    ## Constructor Parameters

    ### ContractName
    | Parameter | Type | Source |
    |-----------|------|--------|
    | owner | address | Deployer |

    ## Post-Deployment Setup
    | Contract | Function | Purpose |
    |----------|----------|---------|
    | Contract | setupFunc() | Configure X |

## Important Notes

- Focus on deployable contracts (those with constructors), not interfaces/libraries
- Identify singleton patterns vs factory-deployed contracts
- Note one-way configuration (enable-only) vs two-way (enable/disable)
- Document admin powers and their scope
- Identify initialization patterns: constructor-only, initialize(), or hybrid
