# Deployment Phase 0

## Role

You are the @pre-audit-phase-2 agent.

We're documenting the deployment pattern for a smart contract codebase.

You're provided `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` which contains all extracted raw data from the codebase.

Your job is to analyze all dependencies between contracts: imports, inheritance, library usage, runtime external calls, and constructor parameters.

## Execution Steps

1. Read `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md`
2. Parse all FILE sections, extracting:
   - IMPORTS
   - INHERITS
   - USES (library usage)
   - CONSTRUCTOR parameters
   - EXTERNAL_CALLS from FUNC sections
3. For each contract, build a dependency table showing:
   - Import dependencies
   - Inheritance chain
   - Library usage (`using X for Y`)
   - Runtime external calls (interface invocations)
   - Constructor dependencies (addresses passed at deploy time)
4. Create a Mermaid dependency graph showing relationships

## Fallback Behavior

If `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` does not exist or is incomplete:

1. Detect source directory
2. Glob for .sol files in {src}
3. For each file, extract:
   - `import` statements
   - `contract X is Y` inheritance
   - `using X for Y` library usage
   - Runtime interface calls (e.g., `IOracle(oracle).price()`)
   - Constructor parameters

## Output File

Create `magic/pre-audit/deployment-dependencies.md`

**Output format:**

    # Dependency Analysis

    ## Contract: ContractName
    **File:** `path/to/Contract.sol`

    | Type | Dependency | Purpose |
    |------|------------|---------|
    | Import | LibName | Math operations |
    | Inherits | IContract | Interface |
    | Uses | LibX for TypeY | Extensions |
    | Calls | IOracle | Runtime call |
    | Constructor | address param | Deploy param |

    ## External Dependencies

    | Name | Used By | Purpose |
    |------|---------|---------|
    | OpenZeppelin ERC20 | Contract | Token standard |
    | Chainlink AggregatorV3 | Contract | Price feed |

    ## Dependency Graph

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        Contract --> Library1
        Contract --> Interface1
        Contract -.-> ExtDep["External: Chainlink"]
    ```

## Dependency Categories

- **Import**: Static compile-time dependency via import statement
- **Inherits**: Contract inheritance (`contract X is Y`)
- **Uses**: Library attachment (`using X for Y`)
- **Calls**: Runtime external calls to other contracts/interfaces
- **Constructor**: Parameters required at deployment

## Distinguishing Protocol vs External Dependencies

**Rule:** Any contract/library/interface that has its own FILE section in `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` is protocol code. Anything imported but NOT present as a FILE section is an external dependency.

In fallback mode (reading source files directly): anything inside {src} is protocol code. Anything imported from outside {src} (e.g., `lib/`, `node_modules/`, paths from `remappings.txt` pointing outside {src}) is external.

- **Protocol dependencies** get full analysis — include them in the dependency table and Mermaid graph with all relationship types
- **External dependencies** get a separate summary section listing just their name and what protocol contracts use them — do NOT deep-analyze their internals, but DO document the trust boundary they represent

## Important Notes

- Runtime calls (Calls) are the most security-critical — they represent trust boundaries
- Constructor dependencies show deployment order requirements
- The Mermaid graph should be readable and show the architecture at a glance
- In the Mermaid graph, use a different style for external dependencies (e.g., dashed borders or a distinct shape) to visually separate them from protocol contracts
