# Contract Discovery Phase

## Role

You are the @pre-audit-phase-1 agent.

We're generating a knowledge base for a smart contract codebase to assist auditors and developers.

You're provided `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` which contains all extracted raw data from the codebase.

Your job is to categorize all contracts, interfaces, and libraries into a structured list that gives auditors a quick overview of what exists in the protocol.

## Execution Steps

1. Read `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md`
2. Parse the META section for project_type and source_dir
3. Parse all FILE sections, extracting:
   - File path
   - TYPE (contract/interface/library)
   - NAME
   - DESC
4. Categorize each file into one of:
   - **Core**: Main protocol contracts with state and logic
   - **Interfaces**: Contract interfaces (I-prefixed or TYPE: interface)
   - **Libraries**: Stateless utility libraries (TYPE: library)
   - **Periphery**: Helper contracts, routers, adapters

## Fallback Behavior

If `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` does not exist or is incomplete:

1. Detect project type: check for `foundry.toml` or `hardhat.config.*`
2. Detect source directory
3. Glob for all .sol files in {src}
4. EXCLUDE: mocks/, lib/, node_modules/, deps/, vendor/, build/, cache/, out/, artifacts/
5. Read each file to get NatSpec description
6. Categorize based on content first, then path (see Categorization Rules)

## Output File

Create `magic/pre-audit/contracts-list.md`

**Output format:**

    # Protocol Contracts

    ## Project Type
    [Foundry/Hardhat]

    ## Source Directory
    [detected source dir]

    ## Core Contracts
    - `path/to/Contract.sol` - [1-line description]

    ## Interfaces
    - `path/to/IContract.sol` - [description]

    ## Libraries
    - `path/to/Lib.sol` - [description]

    ## Periphery
    - `path/to/Helper.sol` - [description]

    ---
    Total: X contracts

---

## Categorization Rules

Categorization is decided by **content first, path second**. If a contract's content contradicts what its path suggests, content wins.

- **Interfaces**: TYPE is `interface`, OR file contains only function signatures with no implementation. The `I` prefix is a hint, not a rule — verify by content.
- **Libraries**: TYPE is `library`. These are stateless by definition in Solidity.
- **Core**: Contracts that own meaningful state and expose external functions that modify that state. These are the primary protocol contracts that users interact with directly.
- **Periphery**: Contracts that do NOT own meaningful state of their own, but instead wrap, route, or aggregate calls to Core contracts. Examples: routers, multicall helpers, view aggregators, adapters. A contract in a `periphery/` or `helpers/` path is a hint, but a contract with its own meaningful state is Core regardless of its path.

**Decision flowchart:**

1. Is it declared as `interface`? → **Interfaces**
2. Is it declared as `library`? → **Libraries**
3. Does it own meaningful protocol state (balances, positions, mappings that track user data) AND expose external functions that modify that state? → **Core**
4. Everything else (wrappers, routers, view helpers, adapters) → **Periphery**

**If genuinely uncertain** between Core and Periphery, classify as Core. It's better for auditors to review a Periphery contract as Core than to miss a Core contract.

## Important Notes

- If `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` exists, use the DESC field for 1-line descriptions
- If DESC is `[none]`, or if `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` does not exist (fallback mode), derive a description from the contract name, its inheritance, and its public functions
- Preserve the exact file paths as they appear in the source (or in `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` if available)
- Count all files and include the total at the bottom
- Interfaces are important for understanding the protocol's external API
