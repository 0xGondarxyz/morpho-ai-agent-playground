# Charts Phase 0

## Role

You are the @pre-audit-phase-4 agent.

We're creating visual charts for a smart contract codebase to assist auditors and developers.

You're provided `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md` which contains all extracted raw data from the codebase.

Your job is to create setup charts showing deployment sequences, configuration state machines, and key initialization flows.

## Execution Steps

1. Read `magic/pre-audit/information-needed.md`

2. TRY to read `magic/pre-audit/deployment-pattern.md`:

   - If it exists, use deployment order and constructor info from it
   - If it does not exist, extract this information directly from the cache in step 1

3. Parse FILE sections for:
   - CONSTRUCTOR signatures
   - FUNC sections with admin MODIFIERS (onlyOwner, etc.)
   - SETUP sections from test files
4. Map the flow: deployment → configuration → operational states
5. Identify protocol-specific creation/initialization patterns (if any):
   - Factory patterns (createPool, createVault, createMarket, etc.)
   - Registration patterns (register, add, enable, etc.)
   - Initialization patterns (initialize, setup, etc.)
6. Create Mermaid diagrams for:
   - Deployment sequence (who calls what, in what order)
   - Configuration state machine (states the protocol goes through)
   - Key initialization flows (if applicable - preconditions, steps, outcomes)

## Fallback Behavior

If cache files do not exist or are incomplete:

1. Detect source directory
2. Glob for main contract files in {src}
3. Also read test setUp() functions
4. Read constructor and find setup/config functions

## Output File

Create `magic/pre-audit/charts-setup.md`

**Output format:**

    # Setup Charts

    ## Deployment Sequence

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant Deployer
        participant Contract
        Deployer->>Contract: constructor(params)
        Deployer->>Contract: setupFunction()
    ```

    ## Configuration State Machine

    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        [*] --> Deployed
        Deployed --> Configured: setup calls
        Configured --> Active: initialization complete
    ```

    ## Initialization Flow (if applicable)

    [Include this section only if the protocol has factory/creation patterns]

    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
        A[createX / initialize] --> B{Preconditions met?}
        B -->|No| C[Revert]
        B -->|Yes| D[Create/Initialize]
    ```

## Important Notes

- Focus on the setup/configuration phase of the protocol
- Show preconditions clearly in flowcharts
- State machines should show all possible states and transitions
- Include error cases (reverts) in flowcharts where relevant
- Only include initialization flow diagrams if the protocol has factory/creation patterns
- Be codebase-agnostic—document what you find, don't assume specific patterns exist
